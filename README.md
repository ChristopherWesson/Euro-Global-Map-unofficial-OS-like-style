# QML stylesheets for EGM in an OS-like style

These are QML files for EuroGlobalMap in Esri Shapefile format for use in QGIS.
They have been designed to work with the Ordnance Survey full colour style.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or download the contents of this repository

**2.**  Load the EGM shape data into QGIS

**3.**  Double click on a layer to access the 'Layer Properties' window > click on 'Load Style...' > navigate to the directory containing the QML files (those ending .qml) > select the QML file that corresponds to that layer > click 'Open' > click 'OK'

*Repeat step 3 for all layers for which a QML has been made*

**4.**  For use as a contextual map I recommend the following layer order and visibility:

I recommend viewing the map between **1:300,000** and **3,000,000** for maximum legibility

Your map should now look similar to this:

  ## Additional information

  *Please note that this is a work in progress based upon limited time I had available. I will try to improve these stylesheets as and when I can but I hope they offer a good starting point for anyone wishing to load EGM into QGIS*
